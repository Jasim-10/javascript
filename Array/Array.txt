An array is a special variable that can hold multiple values in a single variable.
Arrays are ordered and indexed starting from 0.



push():- Adds one or more elements at the end of the array and returns the new length.
pop() :- Removes and returns the last element of the array.

unshift() :- Adds one or more elements at the beginning of the array and returns the new length.
shift() :-	Removes and returns the first element of the array.

indexOf():- Returns the first index of a given element, or -1 if not found.
includes():- Checks whether an array contains a given element (returns true/false).

join():- Joins all elements into a string with a specified separator.


splice():- Adds, removes, or replaces elements at specific positions.
slice():-	Returns a shallow copy of part of the array without modifying it.
                slice = copy
                splice = cut & paste


concat():- Merges two or more arrays and returns a new array.

flat():- Returns a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.
from():- Creates an array from an array-like object.
